# Anon Chat

## Real-time Chat App with MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, React, Node.js, and Socket.io

=======

Chat with people anonymously in one single group chat. This is a simple blueprint for creating a real-time chat application with the MERN stack.

### About the app

- This application is a real-time chat application that allows users to anonymously send messages into a single group chat; the user can see and send messages in real time
- Uses React and Bootstrap for the frontend, Express, the `http` module, and Socket.io as the backend, Mongoose as ORM, and MongoDB as a storage service
- Generates a random ID for the user with the `uuid` module the first time the user connects
- Uses Mongoose to add and get items from the database

### How to use

- Install needed client dependencies with `npm install`
- Run `npm start` in a terminal on the client folder to start the frontend
